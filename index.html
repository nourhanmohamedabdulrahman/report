<h1>"Tourism"</h1>
<p><b>
There is no doubt that the tourism field provides a large number of job opportunities, and when the tourism field thrives, this benefits both the individual and the state. Therefore, we find that countries are competing strongly to attract tourists to visit them, and that is by providing the best offers in terms of the cost of the trip and accommodation, in addition to providing sports and entertainment activities in the tourism program, which makes the tourist enjoy the practice of multiple activities. The good treatment of tourists and the provision of their supplies are factors that attract tourists, and make them think of returning to the same place again.
There has become a great competition between countries to attract the largest number of tourists, and therefore there must be continuous development in the tourist cities, with the addition of new and interesting attractions.
One of the distinguished tourist cities is Dubai, as it enjoys wonderful beaches, luxurious hotels, old commercial markets, and huge commercial centers that provide all the international goods of high quality, in addition to restaurants and entertainment. From the above, it is evident that the provision of multiple tourism activities is one of the most important factors that attract tourists.
Touristic places in Egypt are different and each place has its own climate such as Luxor and Aswan with a warm climate and a bright sun that gives the splendor of the relics excellent performance. Touristic countries such as the Red Sea and the White Sea are characterized by a mild, refreshing climate accompanied by a breath of fresh air and Cairo is moderate.  All these countries in Egypt have many museums and ancient temples and antiquities  because Egypt passed through many civilizations and every civilization left its monuments such  by the Pharaonic or the Fatimid. Everywhere in Egypt tells a story.
